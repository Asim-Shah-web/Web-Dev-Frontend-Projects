      Frontend Projects
==============================

This folder contains a collection of frontend development projects built while learning from two major web development courses:

1. The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann  
2. The Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu

The projects demonstrate key concepts in modern web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. One project (Keeper App) is built using **React.js**.



🔹 Forkify App  
→ Recipe search and bookmarking app using the Forkify API and asynchronous JavaScript.

🔹 Mapty App  
→ Workout tracking app with geolocation and interactive map (Leaflet.js).

🔹 Pig Game  
→ Simple two-player dice game demonstrating game logic and DOM manipulation.

🔹 Guess My Number  
→ A number guessing game using simple JS logic and UI updates.

🔹 Banker App  
→ A mini banking app with login, transfers, loan simulation, auto logout timer, etc.

🔹 Bankist Project  
→ A more advanced version of the banking app featuring sorting, date/timer logic, and UI transitions.

🔹 Bankist Home Page  
→ Responsive, animated landing page with smooth scrolling, sticky nav, and tabbed content.



🔹 Simon Game
